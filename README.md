A CLI tool to install Gentoo or Void Linux with default:
+ DNS over HTTPS (with [Quad9](https://www.quad9.net/)).
+ Vim | Nano installed.
+ Iptables installed (not configured).
+ Sudo installed (not configured).
+ [iwd](https://iwd.wiki.kernel.org/) installed if wifi is detected.
+ No GUI installed.

Hardened System:
+ sysctl.conf with TCP/IP stack hardening and more [Arch](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Sysctl)
+ Kernel parameters enforced (dmesg restricted, kexec disabled, etc)
+ Kernel source (Gentoo) patched with [bask](https://github.com/szorfein/bask).

## Description
Actually, Getch support only the `x86_64` architecture and only with the following archives:
+ **Gentoo**: `stage3-amd64-systemd` [Gentoo](https://www.gentoo.org/downloads/).
+ **Void**: `rootfs glibc` [Void](https://voidlinux.org/download/).

Filesystem supported (with or without encryption)
+ Ext4
+ Lvm
+ ZFS

Boot Manager:
+ **Gentoo**: `BIOS` will use `Grub2` and `systemd-boot` for `UEFI`.
+ **Void**: use only Grub2, encryption for the root fs use luks1.

The ISO images i was able to test and that works:
+ [Archlinux](https://www.archlinux.org/download/)
+ [Archaeidae](https://github.com/szorfein/archaeidae): Custom Archiso that includes ZFS support.

## Dependencies
Getch is build without external libs, so it only require `ruby >= 2.5`.

## Install
Getch is cryptographically signed, so add my public key (if you havenâ€™t already) as a trusted certificate.  
With `gem` installed:

    $ gem cert --add <(curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/szorfein/getch/master/certs/szorfein.pem)
    $ gem install getch -P HighSecurity

If you want to try the master branch (can be unstable):

    # git clone https://github.com/szorfein/getch
    # cd getch
    # ruby -I lib bin/getch -h

## Usage
Just ensure than the script is run with a root account.

    # getch -h

After an install by Getch, take a look on the [wiki](https://github.com/szorfein/getch/wiki).

## Examples
For a french user:

    # getch --zoneinfo "Europe/Paris" --language fr_FR --keymap fr

Install Gentoo on LVM and use a different root disk `/dev/sdc`

    # getch --format lvm --disk sdc

Encrypt your disk with LVM with a french keymap

    # getch --format lvm --encrypt --keymap fr

Encrypt with ext4 and create a new user `ninja`:

    # getch --format ext4 --encrypt --username ninja

With ZFS, if used with `--encrypt`, it use the native ZFS encryption:

    # getch --format zfs

With `Void Linux`:

    # getch --os void --encrypt -k fr

## Troubleshooting

#### Old VG for LVM
If a old volume group exist, `getch` may fail to partition your disk. You have to clean up your device before proceed with `vgremove` and `pvremove`. An short example how doing this with a volume group named `vg0`:

    # vgdisplay | grep vg0
    # vgremove -f vg0
    # pvremove -f /dev/sdb

#### Encryption enable on BIOS with ext4
To decrypt your disk on BIOS system, you have to enter your password twice. One time for Grub and another time for Genkernel. [post](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/GRUB#Encrypted_/boot).  
Also with GRUB, only a `us` keymap is working.

#### ZFS for Gentoo
When Gentoo boot the first time, the pool may fail to start, it's happen when the pool has not been `export` to the ISO. So just `export` your pool from the genkernel shell:

The zpool name should be visible (rpool-150ed here), so enter in the Genkernel shell:

    > shell
    zpool import -f -N -R /tmp rpool-150ed
    zpool export -a

Then, just reboot now, it's all.

*INFO*: To create the zpool, getch use the 5 fist characters from the `partuuid`, just replace `sdX` by your real device:

    # ls -l /dev/disk/by-partuuid/ | grep sdX4
    -> 150ed969...

The pool will be called `rpool-150ed`.

#### ZFS for Void Linux - Enable the boot pool
You have some extras step to do after booting to enable the boot pool, you need this pool when you update your system. It's used mainly by Grub and Dracut.
By default, your /boot is empty because your boot pool is not imported...

    # zpool import -N bpool150ed
    # zfs mount bpool150ed/BOOT/void
    # ls /boot

You should see something in the boot (initramfs, vmlinuz).. Recreate the initramfs.

    # xbps-reconfigure -fa

Transform the boot pool in legacy mode and add this to the fstab:

    # zfs set mountpoint=legacy bpool150ed/BOOT/void
    # echo "bpool150ed/BOOT/void /boot zfs defaults 0 0" >> /etc/fstab
    # mount /boot

The /boot should not be empty again and then, reboot. `fstab` should do this automatically now.   

#### ZFS Encrypted with Void
Well, another weird issue, the first time you boot on your encrypted pool, nothing append. Dracut try to mount inexistent device. Just wait for enter in the shell:

    # ls /lib/dracut/hooks/initqueue/finished/*
    # rm /lib/dracut/hooks/initqueue/finished/dev*
    # exit

Dracut should finally start `mount-zfs.sh` and ask for your password. After you first login, follow instructions above for recompile the initramfs and mount the boot pool and your good.
