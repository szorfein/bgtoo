# Getch
A CLI tool to install Gentoo.

## Description
Actually, Getch support only the [AMD64 handbook](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook:AMD64) and only with the last `stage3-amd64-systemd`.  

BIOS system will use `Grub2` and `systemd-boot` for UEFI. Filesystem supported by Getch are for now:
+ Ext4
+ LVM
+ ZFS

Encryption is also supported.

The ISO images i was able to test and that works:
+ [Archlinux](https://www.archlinux.org/download/)
+ [Archaeidae](https://github.com/szorfein/archaeidae): Custom Archiso that includes ZFS support.

## Install
Getch is cryptographically signed, so add my public key (if you havenâ€™t already) as a trusted certificate.  
With `gem` installed:

    $ gem cert --add <(curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/szorfein/getch/master/certs/szorfein.pem)

    $ gem install getch -P HighSecurity

When you boot from an `iso`, you can install `ruby`, `getch` and correct your `PATH=` directly with the `bin/setup.sh`:

    # sh <(curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/szorfein/getch/master/bin/setup.sh)
    # source ~/.zshrc # or ~/.bashrc

If you want to try the master branch:

    # git clone https://github.com/szorfein/getch
    # cd getch
    # ruby -I lib bin/getch -h

## Usage
Just ensure than the script is run with a root account.

    # getch -h

After an install by Getch, take a look on the [wiki](https://github.com/szorfein/getch/wiki).

## Examples
For a french user:

    # getch --zoneinfo "Europe/Paris" --language fr_FR --keymap fr

Install Gentoo on LVM:

    # getch --format lvm --disk sda

Encrypt your disk with LVM with a french keymap

    # getch --format lvm --encrypt --keymap fr

Encrypt with ext4 and create a home directory /home/ninja

    # getch --format ext4 --encrypt --username ninja

With ZFS:

    # getch --format zfs

## Troubleshooting

#### LVM
Unless your old LVM volume group is also named `vg0`, `getch` may fail to partition your disk. You have to clean up your device before proceed with `vgremove` and `pvremove`. An short example how doing this with a volume group named `vg0`:

    # vgdisplay | grep vg0
    # vgremove -f vg0
    # pvremove -f /dev/sdb

#### Encryption enable on BIOS with ext4
To decrypt your disk on BIOS system, you have to enter your password two times. One time for Grub and another time for the initramfs (Genkernel). [post](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/GRUB#Encrypted_/boot).  
Also with GRUB, only a `us` keymap is working.

#### With ZFS
When Gentoo boot, the pool may fail to start, it's happen when the pool has not been `export` to the ISO. So just reboot on your ISO:

You need the partuuid, pool are create with the first 5 characters, just replace `sdX` by your real device:

    # ls -l /dev/disk/by-partuuid/ | grep sdX4
    -> 150ed969...
    # zpool import -N -R /mnt rpool-150ed

And export them correctly:

    # zpool export -a

It's all.

## Issues
If need more support for your hardware (network, sound card, ...), you can submit a [new issue](https://github.com/szorfein/getch/issues/new) and post the output of the following command:
+ lspci
+ lsmod
